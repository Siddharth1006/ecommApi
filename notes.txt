//Installation done using npm.

1. Install Express.
$ npm install express <Enter>

2. Install MonogDb
Link: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/

Now install mongoose :
https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose

3. Install nodemon
Link: https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon
(Installed globally so its not showing in package.json file)

4.Install dotenv
Link: https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv 

Step2:
We will be using nodemon to continuosly hot reload the changed/edited file, save it and runs the app automatically.

For that, go to package.json > "scripts" > "test" and change test to "start".
and then "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1" to "nodemon index.js"


Step3:
Go to terminal and type : $ npm start  => nodemon is in action! If you make any edits, nodemon will
automatically "hot-reload" the application!

Git Issues I faced:
------------------

https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2019/03/git-create-dev-branch-and-merge/ 

After creating repository, I tried to push, but github says compare and pull request. 
When I see there, there isn't anything to compare. Its the first pull request. 
So Solution:

  ▶  git push
fatal: The current branch main has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use
