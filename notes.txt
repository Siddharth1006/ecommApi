2. Install MonogDb
Link: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/

Now install mongoose :
https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose

3. Install nodemon
Link: https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon
(Installed globally so its not showing in package.json file)

4.Install dotenv
Link: https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv 

Step2:
We will be using nodemon to continuosly hot reload the changed/edited file, save it and runs the app automatically.

For that, go to package.json > "scripts" > "test" and change test to "start".
and then "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1" to "nodemon index.js"


Step3:
Go to terminal and type : $ npm start  => nodemon is in action! If you make any edits, nodemon will
automatically "hot-reload" the application!
